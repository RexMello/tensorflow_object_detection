This is a demo of how to use tensorflow's object detection model in your code.
I do not own any of the models provided, only the code is written by me

All you need to install is opencv-python and you should be good to go. This model is trained against 91 objects you can check the name and indexes of these objects on tensorflows official website.
Basically in order to detect an object you need to pass its ID and the code will try to detect it in given frame/image.
